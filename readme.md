# Presentation

This extension allows you to modify the order of the information in a file announced by NVDA in the list of search results, as well as to activate or deactivate the announcement of column names in the Everything software.

## How it works

Once this extension is installed, by default, the announcement of the columns is as follows: name, date, size, path.
To change the order of the columns, go to the NVDA preferences menu and scroll down to the Everything section.
In this section, you will find a checkbox that allows you to enable or disable the announcement of column names.
Then, you will find 3 lists where you can choose each time the element you want to appear in order.
After these lists, you will also find a button that allows you to return to the default settings.
Once finished, click on OK.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

When the Everything software is open, the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+O allows you to directly open the extension's settings panel. Make your changes and click on OK to confirm. The changes take effect immediately.
